As I lined up at the start of Gravmageddon 2024, I couldn't help but reflect on my previous experience with this epic ultra gravel race. In 2023, I had taken on the challenge, eager to test my limits and conquer the 360km route with 7,400m of elevation gain. Looking back, I can now firmly say that Gravmageddon falls squarely into the realm of "Type 2 fun" - the kind of experience that's miserable while it's happening, but incredibly rewarding in retrospect.

## The Race

This year's edition of Gravmageddon promised to be even more challenging, as the weather forecast called for rains and strong wind gusts throughout the day. True to its reputation, Mother Nature did not disappoint. By the time I reached the first checkpoint at 110km, I was soaked to the bone, both from the relentless rain and the accumulated sweat under my waterproof shell. To make matters worse, the temperature had plummeted to a chilly 5 degrees Celsius on Polana Jakuszycka, and I still had over 230km and an entire night of riding ahead of me.

Yet, as I pushed on, navigating the treacherous gravel and rocky paths, I couldn't help but feel a sense of exhilaration. The Karkonosze Mountains, with their alpine climate and legendary tales of the Karkonosz (the Spirit of the Mountains), provided a stunning backdrop to the suffering. The route took us through a diverse landscape, from the technical singletrack sections to the fast, smooth tarmac, each offering its own unique challenge.

As I pushed my bike up the relentless climbs, I couldn't help but appreciate the sheer scale of the Karkonosze Mountains. The famous Przesieka - Karkonosze Pass, with its 7km of climbing and 670m of elevation gain, was just the first of many challenges that lay ahead. Steep sections like the 9km, 450m climb at Dolni Stepanice and the 7.4km, 518m ascent to Ještěd tested the limits of my gearing and my determination.

But it was the night section that truly pushed me to my limits. Navigating the rocky singletrack trails under the stars, with only the beam of my headlamp to guide me, required a level of focus and skill that I had never before experienced. The rush of adrenaline on the technical descents provided a much-needed energy boost, propelling me forward towards the second checkpoint at around 3am.
