At the end of August, I took part in the Warta Gravel, a 410 km ultra-endurance race starting and finishing in Poznań, Poland. The route was special to me, following paths I've known since childhood and running alongside the Warta River. Since the start was only 10 km from my home, I ended up adding an extra 20 km to my ride, to and from the race.

## The Race

### Race Route

The Warta Gravel route followed the Warta River, passing through some of the best natural areas around Poznań, including Zielonka Forest, Noteć Forest, and Sieraków Landscape Park. It was a mostly flat course, with just 1,800 meters of elevation gain over 400 km, making it fast in many sections, especially on premium white gravel paths. Grocery stores were conveniently spaced along the way, except for a 100 km stretch after 305 km, where there were no open shops until the finish.

While the route featured plenty of gravel and even some tarmac, it also included cobblestone sections and my least favorite: sandy washboard roads.

### Strategy

My strategy was simple: keep pedaling and minimize stops. I only planned to stop at grocery stores close to the route, avoiding time-consuming restaurant meals. To limit the need for stops, I packed my frame bag with energy gels and bars, and carried two water bottles (1.3L total) plus a hydration vest with 1.5L capacity. The extra water proved invaluable in the race.

I intended to ride with my friends for the first 50-100 km to keep it social, but I realized I needed to hit 300 km (Sieraków) by 11 PM to make it through the night. So, I picked up my pace and went solo earlier than planned.

### Conditions

The heat was brutal, with thermometers reading 30°C in the shade, and my Wahoo recording a max temperature of 37°C during the day. Riding through open areas was exhausting, and I had to keep sipping water and reminding myself to take salt capsules and electrolytes regularly. Fortunately, aside from being tired, I had no major issues, and once dusk arrived and the temperature dropped, the ride became much more enjoyable.

### Results

I stuck to my plan and kept breaks to a minimum. In the first 100 km, I had just ~10 minutes of paused time, which felt great! Ultimately, I finished in 22 hours and 10 minutes, with 19 hours and 50 minutes of riding time. I could have been faster in the final 200 km, but my seat became uncomfortable, and my recent bike fit wasn't quite right. Despite that, I managed to finish 36th out of 250 participants.

While I enjoyed the race, riding 400 km on such flat terrain can get a bit boring. It's definitely not as dynamic or scenic as something like [Gravmageddon](/gravmageddon-2023-karkonosze-izery-gravel-race), where you can enjoy mountains and beautiful views — assuming it doesn't rain for the whole race!
