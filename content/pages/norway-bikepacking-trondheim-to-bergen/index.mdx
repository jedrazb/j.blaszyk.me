> Pack light, travel far.

The motto of our journey. This year for the first time, we ditched rear racks and panniers in favour of a much lighter bikepacking setup. It paid off, as climbing from fjords, on sea level, to high mountain passes and glaciers suddenly became feasible. With an elevation gain of 14,000m, our journey was mostly about long uphills and rewarding views. Even seemingly flat segments would become zigzags when zooming in on the Komoot elevation profile. The weather was also a challenge. Packing so light, we had to carry everything we needed to cycle in the scorching sun, heavy rains or thunderstorms with snow lying around high up in the mountains.

This year, I managed to pack a proper camera to capture moments from our adventure. Welcome to the relation from the 2022 Norway Bikepacking trip.

## Route

We followed a segment of the [Bikepacking Around Norway](https://www.adventurebikeracing.com/aroundnorway/) race ([Komoot route](https://www.komoot.com/collection/1305106/-around-norway)). We started at Trondheim airport and had to cover 1000km and 14,000m of elevation gain to make it on time for our flight back from Bergen. The route led us along bike paths, remote roads and a few gravel sections. There were a lot of uphills and downhills; even when cycling around fjords, we rarely had a flat segment.

We've never had issues with tunnels as the race organisers did the work to check that all tunnels have either a cycling bypass or are cycling friendly. Though, we heard stories from other bike packers that they had to take a lengthy diversion to go around long tunnels where cycling is forbidden. During our trip, we discovered [this tunnel map](https://www.cycletourer.co.uk/maps/tunnelmap.shtml) created by the bikepacking community that can serve as a good reference when planning a route.

Some interesting spots on our route included Trollstigen, a famous serpentine road, Geirangerfjord and Sognefjellet - the highest mountain pass in Norway. On our way, we had four ferry crossings which are free of charge for cyclists.

## Wildcamping

The freedom to stay and camp anywhere in nature takes from [the Everyman's Right](https://www.lifeinnorway.net/camping-in-norway/) (Norwegian Allemannsretten); it is a customary right of every human being to enjoy nature regardless of the ownership of the land. You can wild camp for a maximum of 2 nights in the same spot, on uncultivated land and at least 150m away from the nearest house.

During our trip, we had no issues with finding wild camping spots. We camped in different locations, near lakes, fjords and forests.

## Journey

### Days 1-3: Norwegian climbing prelude

Just before landing, I could see forests, snow-topped peaks, lakes and immense masses of clouds. It was only 13 degrees outside; chilly temperature struck us as we exited the plane.

Upon arrival at the airport's main hall with our bikes packed in boxes, we learned that nothing gets lost in nature. Other bikepackers approached us, asking us to reuse our cardboard boxes, sharing stories and giving tips for our journey. The most helpful advice was to ditch Apple weather in favour of a local weather provider, [yr.no](https://www.yr.no/), which works fantastic for that region.

Soon, we finished assembling our bikes, mounted the bags, and put on our warm, waterproof clothes. We were ready for the adventure to begin.

The first two days of the trip were the coldest. I was unhappy with my choice of leaving GoreTex gloves and winter leg warmers at home. It was windy, cold, with almost constant drizzle. We spent the first night wild-camping on a lake; the temperature dropped so low that I felt cold in my 0 degrees comfort sleeping bag. On the second day, we cycled up to Oppdal, a ski resort town. It was still chilly outside, but at least it stopped raining. We spent the night camping near the city in the forest to get breakfast from the supermarket in the morning.

The constant cold weather worried me about our plan to climb high mountain passes. Luckily, on the third day of the journey, the weather got a bit better, and the weather forecasts for the coming days were improving. We spend the third night wild camping at the Langfjorden, with a beautiful view of the fjord. It was a great spot to recover before coming days full of long climbs.
