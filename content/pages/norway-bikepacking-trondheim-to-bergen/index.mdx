> Pack light, travel far.

The motto of our journey. This year for the first time, we ditched rear racks and panniers in favour of a much lighter bikepacking setup. It paid off, as climbing from fjords, on sea level, to high mountain passes and glaciers suddenly became feasible. With an elevation gain of 14,000m, our journey was mostly about long uphills and rewarding views. Even seemingly flat segments would become zigzags when zooming in on the Komoot elevation profile. The weather was also a challenge. Packing so light, we had to carry everything we needed to cycle in the scorching sun, heavy rains or thunderstorms with snow lying around high up in the mountains.

This year, I managed to pack a proper camera to capture moments from our adventure. Welcome to the relation from the 2022 Norway Bikepacking trip.

## Route

We followed a segment of the [Bikepacking Around Norway](https://www.adventurebikeracing.com/aroundnorway/) race ([Komoot route](https://www.komoot.com/collection/1305106/-around-norway)). We started at Trondheim airport and had to cover 1000km and 14,000m of elevation gain to make it on time for our flight back from Bergen. The route led us along bike paths, remote roads and a few gravel sections. There were a lot of uphills and downhills; even when cycling around fjords, we rarely had a flat segment.

We've never had issues with tunnels as the race organisers did the work to check that all tunnels have either a cycling bypass or are cycling friendly. We heard stories from other bike packers that they had to take a lengthy diversion to go around long tunnels where cycling is forbidden. During our trip, we discovered [this tunnel map](https://www.cycletourer.co.uk/maps/tunnelmap.shtml) created by the bikepacking community that can serve as a good reference when planning a route.

Some interesting spots on our route included Trollstigen - a famous serpentine road, Geirangerfjord and Sognefjellet - the highest mountain pass in Norway. On our way, we had four ferry crossings which are usually free of charge for cyclists.

## Wildcamping

The freedom to stay and camp anywhere in nature takes from [the Everyman's Right](https://www.lifeinnorway.net/camping-in-norway/) (Norwegian Allemannsretten); it is a customary right of every human being to enjoy nature regardless of the ownership of the land. It's permitted to wild camp for a maximum of 2 nights in the same spot, on uncultivated land and at least 150m away from the nearest house.

During our trip, we had no issues with finding wild camping spots. We camped in different locations, near lakes, fjords and forests.

## Journey

### Days 1-3: Norwegian climbing prelude

When landing, I could see forests, snow-topped peaks, lakes and immense masses of clouds. Norway welcomed us with rain. It was only 13 degrees outside; chilly temperature struck us as we exited the plane.

Upon arrival at the airport's main hall with our bikes packed in boxes, we learned that nothing gets lost in nature. Other bikepackers approached us, asking us to reuse our cardboard boxes. They also shared stories and gave tips for our journey. The most helpful advice was to ditch Apple weather in favour of a local weather provider, [yr.no](https://www.yr.no/), which works fantastic for that region.

Soon, we finished assembling our bikes, mounted the bags, and put on our warm, rainproof clothes. We were ready for the adventure to begin.

The first two days of the trip were the coldest. I was unhappy with my choice of leaving GoreTex gloves and winter leg warmers at home. It was windy, cold, with almost constant drizzle. We spent the first night wild-camping on a lake; the temperature dropped so low that I felt cold in my 0 degrees comfort sleeping bag. On the second day, we cycled up to Oppdal, a ski resort town. It was still chilly outside, but at least it stopped raining. We spent the night camping near the city in the forest to get breakfast from the supermarket in the morning.

The constant cold weather worried me about our plan to climb high mountain passes. Luckily, on the third day of the journey, the weather got a bit better, and the weather forecasts for the coming days were improving. We spend the third night wild camping at the Langfjorden, with a beautiful view of the fjord. It was a great spot to recover before coming days full of long climbs.

### Days 4-7: Up, up, up

That was the most beautiful part of the trip. It finally became less rainy, and from time to time, we could even see the sun bursting through the thick layer of clouds. Better weather made us start the most challenging part of our trip in a good mood. Four big climbs awaited us: Trollsteigen, then two uphills around Geirangerfjord, and finally Sognefjellet mountain pass, which would take us to 1428m.

Another challenge was food. There were (surprisingly!) no grocery stores high up in the mountains. Carrying all the necessary food up the mountains was not feasible as we wanted to save on weight during the climbs, and also our bags were already packed to their limits. Therefore, after every climb, we still had to cycle an extra distance to reach an open grocery store down in the valley.

#### Trollstiegen

Trollstigen is one of the most visually stunning cycling climbs I've ever done. The climb starts at Romsdalsfjorden and then sneaks up the dramatic, rocky mountainside to 870m. It has 11 famously sharp turns; the average gradient for the central part of the climb hovers around 8%.

#### Geiranger

To begin our main climb that day, we first had to reach Geiranger by Møllsbygda. It meant starting our day with 630m of the uphill and steep descent down to the Geirangerfjord. We took a short break in the village, and soon we were off to a 1000m climb which spanned almost 17km. With surroundings created by the ice ages, when glaciers carved out fjords and sculpted the high mountains, calling this route impressive is an understatement.

#### Sognefjellet

Sognefjellet is northern Europe's highest mountain pass which took us to 1428m. It was a long 50km climb, starting in Lom. It took us almost 5 hours of cycling uphill to get to the top. Upon reaching the high point of the road, we could see the blue tongue of the glacier. We just managed to snap a few pictures at the top before the forecasted thunderstorms and heavy rain started. We were in luck; just 100m away, there was a great tourist shelter where we waited for almost 2 hours hoping for the weather to improve. Unfortunately, it didn't, so we put on rain jackets and every warm layer we had and proceeded on a long, rainy and windy descent to Lustrafjorden.

### Day 8-10: One more climb, and soon Bergen

The weather changed completely; instead of cold and rain, we had to now ride in the scorching sun and heat. After passing the last 1000m "tooth" on the route elevation profile, we were done with big climbs and had a relatively flat segment to Bergen.

The rainiest city in Europe didn't disappoint us. It rained close to 100% time that we had spent there. Looking for a shelter, we entered a fish market next to the harbour. There we had a proper seafood feast and some beers.

On the last day of the trip, we cycled to [Trek Bergen](https://trekbergen.no/) bike shop, as we had asked them to save cardboard bike boxes for us. They did it for free! We spent 2 hours disassembling and packing our bikes at the airport. We were heading home thinking about what bikepacking adventure awaits us next year.
