This summer, Ann and I decided to ditch warm, sunny destinations to explore the land of ice and fire - Iceland. It’s a destination unlike any other in Europe. Its unique landscapes, smouldering volcanoes and blue glaciers complement the modern lifestyle and especially the coffee culture of the capital city Reykjavik.

### Car rental

The best way to get around the country is to rent a car. There are two options to consider, either a regular 2WD or a 4x4 car suitable for driving on highland gravel roads, called F-roads. We went for the latter and on many occasions, it proved to be an absolute necessity for us to get to our planned destinations. One thing to note, most 4x4 rentals don’t have insurance for river crossings - which are not as uncommon as it sounds on F-roads. Even with an off-road car, we avoided river crossings, as we witness other people flooding their cars - I managed to snap a photo (it’s at the end of this post) of the rescue team preparing to get a car out of the river. It’s recommended to check for current road conditions on [road.is](https://www.road.is/).

### Camping

Camping is a great way to immerse in Icelandic nature, it’s also way cheaper and more available than sparsely scattered hotels and guesthouses. Since we had the gear we opted for sleeping in a tent rather than a car. We took a lightweight three-season tent, (very) warm sleeping bags (0°C and -20°C comfort) and lots of warm and waterproof clothes. Sun never fully sets in the summer months, so we were always able to pitch the tent in daylight.

The best time to visit is between June and August when the mean temperature is at its peak. It doesn’t mean that there is a lot of sunlight. The weather during our stay was fairly cloudy with 2 “sunny” days, a bit of rain, and a few fairly cold nights (around 5°C).

## 8 Day Roadtrip

We stayed in Iceland for 8 days. We decided not to go 1,400km along the famous ring road, as we didn't have enough time to properly see all the sights on the way. Also, following the ring road means staying on the tarmac all the time. Since we had a 4x4 car we wanted to enjoy highland gravel roads. We decided to focus initially on the western and then southern parts of Iceland. On our way back to Reykjavik we followed F-roads through the Fjallabak Nature Reserve and Landmannalaugar - the most scenic part of our road trip.

## Day 1: Ride to Snæfellsnes Peninsula

We landed at Keflavik airport in the afternoon and picked up our car from [IcePol](https://icepole.eu/) - a local car rental company (we had a great experience). There, we also rented some camping gear: a folding table and chairs, cutlery and a gas stove - so that we could have a proper morning coffee. Car pickup went smoothly and soon after landing we were already in the car driving towards Snæfellsnes Penninsula. Passing by Reykjavik, we stopped by a big store to buy food for the next few days. On the way, we stopped by Gerðuberg Cliffs and Bjarnarfoss. After a few hours, we arrived at Hellissandur Camping. It was a nice campsite to spend the night with good grounds for pitching the tent.

## Day 2: Snæfellsnes Peninsula

We explored Snæfellsnes Peninsula by following a rocky road to Skarðsvík Beach and Svörtuloft Lighthouse. Then we got to the main road which took us to a Hellnar View Point with Fjöruhúsið café nearby, they offer great coffee and delicious fish soup, highly recommend. We also walked around Kirkjufell Mountain - known as [Arrowhead Mountain](https://www.kimkim.com/c/game-of-thrones-sights-in-iceland) from Game of Thrones. When going to our next campsite we stopped by Landbrotalaug Hot Spring, it was empty when we arrived. We spent the night at Mosskogar Camping - a great outpost for starting the Golden Circle tour the following day.

## Day 3: Golden Circle

The Golden Circle follows the “must-see” touristic destinations in Iceland. It includes Þingvellir National Park located in a rift valley created by the drifting apart of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, you can see the edges of the plates when walking around the park. The next stop is at the Geysir park, where the Great Geysir erupts every 10 minutes. Another landmark on the way is Gullfoss, a huge waterfall, definitely worth seeing. We also managed to jump into Kualaug hot spring, very muddy and small, but warm. We camped at Camping Fljótshlið which is located on the way to waterfalls and glaciers.

## Day 4: Foss Day

_Foss_ is the Icelandic word for waterfall, so on a Foss day, we’ve seen many beautiful waterfalls. We visited Gluggafoss, Seljalandsfoss (there is a path leading “inside”) and Skógafoss (a great location for photos). We also took a break and hiked to Seljavallalaug Pool to chill in its warm water which comes from a local hot spring. It’s an outdoor swimming pool located in the mountains, built in the year 1923 by a local who wanted to teach kids how to swim. Nowadays, it’s open to everybody willing to hike up the mountains to jump into the pool. We ended our day with a hike to Solheimasandur Plane Wreck, but I don’t think taking a photo there is worth hiking for 1.5 hours.

We spent our 4th night in Þakgil camping, located high up in Katla geopark, on Katla volcano - one of Iceland's largest and most active volcanoes. It's located near Vik city. The road leading there requires a 4x4 car and is one of the most scenic routes we've driven in Iceland. The campsite is located in a valley with many hiking trails which take you around the geopark.

## Day 5: Glacier Day

My favourite part of the trip started on that day. First we needed to leave the campsite, it meant driving down on rough gravel roads to Vik. Then we headed south-east towards one of the biggest glaciers in Europe. On the way, we stopped by a beautiful foss: Svartifoss which is surrounded by hexagonal columns of basalt. Their geometric shape is a result of physical processes occurring inside a lava flow during a cool-down. The main attraction of the day were glacier lagoons, which still, blue waters were dotted with icebergs from the surrounding glacier. We’ve also had a very nice chat with a bike-packer - [Chris Hankey](https://chrishankey-artist.com/) - who is spending two months this summer cycling around Iceland.

## Day 6: F-Roads Day

Not driving on F-roads with a 4x4 rental is a sin. We spent this whole day driving on a rocky road to Landmannalaugar located in Fjallabak Nature Reserve - known for its natural geothermal hot springs and surrounding landscape - my favourite, the most picturesque spot of the trip.

## Day 7: Reykjavik and Chill

We took it slow, spent some time in Reykjavik - tried famous hot dogs and got great coffee in Reykjavik Roasters cafe. Then we indulged ourselves with the 7 Step Icelandic Ritual in Sky Lagoon - located just outside the capital city.

## Day 8: Reykjanes Volcano and Airport

It was a short day, we only had time for a hike to the Fagradalsfjall volcano, which erupted in 2021. We could still see the fumes coming out of cooling down lava. (Un)fortunately there were no active volcanic eruptions during our stay, so seeing red, hot, flowing lava was impossible.

- [Hot Springs Map](https://icelandtravelguide.is/hot-spring-map/) - useful map with plenty of hot springs locations.
- [Campsites Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1wk_t105qo4BYqaBL7xTcLUz5uXQ&ll=64.97646224919062%2C-19.022746749999992&z=6) - absolute must when camping, includes all campsites in Iceland, has useful info like prices, whether they accept debit cards or what amenities are available. Much better than Google Maps!
- [road.is](https://www.road.is/) - important website with current road conditions, check before driving or you might flood your rental car like that:
